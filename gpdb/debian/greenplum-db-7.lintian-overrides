# Greenplum Database includes shell configuration file (greenplum_path.sh) that
# determines the value of GPHOME and sets some additional variables
# (LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PYTHONPATH, etc.). Users are expected to edit this file if
# they have installed additional GPDB packages. The file greenplum_path.sh is
# marked as a configuration file to avoid losing any edits made to it by the
# user.
